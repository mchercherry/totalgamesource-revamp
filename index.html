    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>We are teachers with a wide range of successful teaching and coaching experiences who are passionate about providing superior education whether it is in the classroom, in the gym, or on the field! Far beyond the sport, instructors have the incredible privilege of molding children’s self image and thus their future. 
    <br>Instructors do not teach sports; rather they teach children how to do sports. Our passion is to teach and inspire instructors by improving their delivery skills and knowledge so they can maximize their positive impact on children’s lives. When instructors are motivated to enhance their teaching methods and their relationships with the children, success is immediate, sustained, and exponential on multiple fronts. We strive to further equip instructors with the tools they need to recognize and meet children’s needs.</p>

        <h2>Instructional Training</h2>
        <p>At its core, coaching any sport is really teaching. So how can coaches improve their teaching skills to maximize success for athletes? We look to the best principles of education and translate them into theoretically sound and practical coaching methods. The same concepts master teachers use to impart knowledge in their students can be used to improve athletic performance.

        <h2>Game-Shops&trade;</h2>
        <p>Children can rehearse and learn a variety of life skills through playing games. Do your students need to practice patience? Then play a game that requires taking turns. Do your students need to develop strength and fitness? Attention and focus? Cooperation? Team-bonding? Creative problem solving? We have games for all of these and much more!
        <br>From quick, simple ideas with minimal set-up to more complex activities, we have a massive game database to share. More importantly, we teach how to modify games to meet the various needs of your students.
